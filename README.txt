COVID Information Bot for Twitter (Final Year Project)
This bot is created with the intention of providing users more information on a statement,
allowing them to make their own judgements based on information aside from the statement.

The bot has the following features:
- Text Classification (SVM)
- Keyword Extraction (Keybert)
- News Querying (PyGoogleNews)

Data pre-processing and TF-IDF has also been utilized in the creation of this project.
