Face Censor (Computer Vision Assignment)
This project is a introductory computer vision assignment. 
I have decided to look into face masking methods and implement them.
The following are the description of the two separate folders:

Dlib Eye filter: A simple, floating bar tracking the user's eyes

Streamlit Mediapipe (Masking): 
A streamlit application supporting mediapipe's capabilities to blur and overlay face mesh.
Parameters on detection and mesh are adjustable via interface.

Both applications support video and webcam input.
