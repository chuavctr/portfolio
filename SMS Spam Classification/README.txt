Evaluation of SMS Spam Message Classification Model
This study is an evaluation of text classfication models on SMS texts.
The texts have undergone text pre-processing techniques prior to model training.
TF-IDF and Bag of Words (BoW) are used for feature extraction.
Five models are used and compared to determine the optimal model suitable for SMS classification:
1. Naive Bayes (Multinomial NB)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
5. Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) 

The models are also deployed onto streamlit, allowing users to have an interface to interact with our findings.
