## COVID Information Bot
COVID Information Bot for Twitter (Final Year Project)
This bot is created with the intention of providing users more information on a statement,
allowing them to make their own judgements based on information aside from the statement.

The bot has the following features:
- Text Classification (SVM)
- Keyword Extraction (Keybert)
- News Querying (PyGoogleNews)

Data pre-processing and TF-IDF has also been utilized in the creation of this project.
If you'd like to see demonstrations on Twitter, you can check it out here:

## Effectiveness of Malaysia’s Movement Control Order 
A review in the effectiveness of Malaysia’s Movement Control Order 
(MCO) and its subsequent phases

Victor Chua, Joseph Chang, Dr Law Foong Li
UOW Malaysia KDU

This is a study done to determine Malaysia's implementation of Movement Control Order, 
specifically on its effectiveness in curbing the rise of new cases. 
The study is done during the early stages of the pandemic from January to August of 2020. 
Linear and Logistic Regression models are used in this study to determine the overall trend in positive cases.

## Mock MySejahtera (COVID-19 Location Logging System)
Data Structure Assignment:
Location Logging System (Mock MySejahtera)
I am assigned to create a C++ console app that replicates the application MySejahtera, 
Malaysia's primary method of tracking a user's whereabouts.
- Registration of Individual
- Registration of Dependants
- Health Declaration
- Location Logging
- Basic location red zone cross check & status update

This console app was designed based on the programming concepts that I have learned:
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Structures
- Overloaded functions


## SMS Spam Classification: A comparison of different models
Evaluation of SMS Spam Message Classification Model
This study is an evaluation of text classfication models on SMS texts.
The texts have undergone text pre-processing techniques prior to model training.
TF-IDF and Bag of Words (BoW) are used for feature extraction.
Five models are used and compared to determine the optimal model suitable for SMS classification:
1. Naive Bayes (Multinomial NB)
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
5. Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) 

The models are also deployed onto streamlit, allowing users to have an interface to interact with our findings.


## Face Censoring System
Face Censor (Computer Vision Assignment)
This project is a introductory computer vision assignment. 
I have decided to look into face masking methods and implement them.
The following are the description of the two separate folders:

Dlib Eye filter: A simple, floating bar tracking the user's eyes

Streamlit Mediapipe (Masking): 
A streamlit application supporting mediapipe's capabilities to blur and overlay face mesh.
Parameters on detection and mesh are adjustable via interface.

Both applications support video and webcam input.
