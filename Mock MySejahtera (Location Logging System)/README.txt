Data Structure Assignment:
Location Logging System (Mock MySejahtera)
I am assigned to create a C++ console app that replicates the application MySejahtera, 
Malaysia's primary method of tracking a user's whereabouts.
- Registration of Individual
- Registration of Dependants
- Health Declaration
- Location Logging
- Basic location red zone cross check & status update

This console app was designed based on the programming concepts that I have learned:
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Structures
- Overloaded functions
